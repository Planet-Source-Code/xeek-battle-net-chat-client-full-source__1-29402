the mp3 options aren't there yet
i'm just not that great at making commands...
they're started though, and the source is there to be used

it's for the people who know how to use class modules 'n shit (if they're continuing it)

just because i'm posting it before it's done, doesn't mean i'm not going to keep working
on it... i'm only posting it because everything but the mp3 options are done, and i don't
know when i'll be online again

anyways, peep it out, i got the buddy list thinger to work, and the chat works like a charm
the blue in the chat needs to be a little lighter, but o well, i couldn't get ALL the colors
just right... but then again there are other games (and their own colors) that access b.net

battle.net restricted access to bots, the list of servers (only 4 exist), but there are other
3rd party servers out there, so i left the custom server in the menu...
really nicely coded i think

uhmm...
unless you have a game from blizzard (diablo, warcraft, starcraft), this isn't really for you,
but if you still want to peep it out, log in anonymously and you'll still be able to check out
some of the features
